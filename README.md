## Design & Planning:
### Business model
- Row to Grow is an e-commerce website that specializes in rowing-related products, such as clothing, accessories, and education. Our business model is centered around providing high-quality products at affordable prices, with a focus on serving rowing community. We believe that by focusing on the needs of our customers and providing excellent customer service, we can establish ourselves as a trusted and respected brand in the rowing community and beyond since we also have products that are not so called "rowing-related" and are more "mainstream"
 - To achieve our business goals, we carefully select our suppliers based on the quality of their products, their reputation in the industry, and their commitment to sustainable and ethical practices. 
 - To support our business model, we have implemented a range of operational strategies to ensure that we can deliver the best possible customer experience. We offer fast and reliable shipping, easy returns and exchanges, and a customer support team that is available to answer any questions or concerns.By prioritizing customer satisfaction, we believe that we can build long-term relationships with our customers and establish ourselves as a good provider of sports related products.

### Marketing 
#### B2C 
The application is primarily B2C focused, catering to individual customers who wish to purchase rowing related products

#### Strategies
- At Row to Grow, we understand the importance of effective marketing strategies to drive traffic to our website and increase our sales. Our current marketing strategies include:

- Social Media: We have created a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100092653627209) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rowto_grow/?fbclid=IwAR1LHVbMfc3Ypo-tBhXvJH1TNpzzMbn2iyowSml0UgkYor25RQ4zspwrwGU) page for our business to reach out to potential customers and promote our products. By regularly posting engaging content and interacting with our followers, we aim to build an online presence to increase our brand awareness. Our both pages are live and active but in case they becomes inactive or deactivated I have taken screenshots to display here as well

By attending local events and sponsoring local athletes, we aim to establish ourselves as a trusted and respected brand within the community.Also by sponsoring local athletes we extend our reach in marketing area in an old fashion way "Word of a mouth"

SEO: We understand the importance of effective SEO strategies to increase our website's visibility in search engines like Google which will be explained more in next section.

### SEO
- When planning the SEO strategy for Row to Grow, our e-commerce website focused on rowing-related products, we began by conducting thorough keyword research. We utilized semrush.com and wordtracker.com to identify short tail and long tail keywords that we could use to improve our search engine rankings.

- Our short-tail keywords include terms such as "Rowing Products, Rowing Accessories, Rowing Clothing, Rowing Books, Rowing Gear, Rowing Equipment, Rowing Apparel, Rowing Gift, Rowing" while our long-tail keywords are more specific and include phrases like "Rowing clothing for women, Rowing clothing for men, Rowing books for beginners, Rowing gear for student rowers, Rowing equipment for competitive rowers, Rowing equipment for coaches, Rowing gifts for enthusiasts" By analyzing the results from Google Trends and related search queries, we were able to generate a comprehensive list of targeted keywords.

- We strategically placed these keywords throughout our website, ensuring that they were included in important on-page elements such as headings, descriptions, and URLs. We also made use of the Strong tag where necessary to highlight key phrases and improve our website's overall searchability.

### Agile Methodology
During the development of this project, I implemented Agile development practices to ensure a flexible and iterative approach to the project's progress. The Agile methodology enabled me to adapt to changing requirements and efficiently manage the development process of this project. It is still a learning process for me as this was only my second time doing it so I found that quite bit challenging and time-consuming. I've created Kanban board to manage and visualize the workflow. 
 - Project board was divided into 3 sections:
   - To-Do- (all user stories were initially entered in the 'To Do' column)
   - In Progress- (then during the development phase and implementing functionality stories were moved into the 'In Progress' column)
   - Done- (and then finally they get moved into 'Done' once the development completes and functionality is implemented to cover that user story)

- I've planned 3 iterations for this project. Two were completed as planned and the third one is for future development of the webiste, which is described more in feature features in this document

- Each milestone consists of user stories, which are displayed either open or closed depending on the progress. Each user story is labeled either as 'must-have', 'should-have', or 'could-have' depending on the needs of the project with estimated story points attached to it.

- Each user story has acceptance criteria and tasks that needed to be done to accomplish that criteria

I do realize the importance of the agile approach and documenting all steps and procedures, but it is quite challenging when you are just a team of 1 and you have to write and do everything like multiple people are working on this project. I do think with time and practice better implementation of the methodology can be achieved.


### Typography
For this project I picked Montserrat which is a widely used font known for it's clarity, and versatility. It's clean and modern design makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, including headings, body text, and branding. As a backdrop font I've used 'Sans-serif'.

### Color scheme

# Features

 Navigation: 
  - navigation was coded along the walkthrough video with some modifications. I believe that navigation from a walkthrough video is a good example of an e-commerce website as it displays features like a shopping bag & search bar which indicates what type of website it is
  - navigation sticks on top of the page and it's divided into 2 sections/ rows. The first row consists of the website logo, search bar, login/logout/register button, and basket. The second row displays different pages on the website and the number of displayed links depends if it's site visitor, registered user, or superuser
  - when on medium to small screens the navigation menu changes to the burger menu which shows all the nav links when clicked on

- Product page:
  - products page is fully responsive to allow equal spacing between products regardless of screen width
  - each product consists of an image, title, price, category & rating, special fields are displayed for the superuser which will all be covered in features: "admin"
  - pagination is created to display only 8 products per page

- Product detail page:
    - single product is displayed on a page with additional information and various option for the user such as a description of the product, an option to pick sizes, quantity and 'add to bag' button
    - additional features 'add to wishlist & 'add review' are displayed only for registered users
    - for both features, there is displayed paragraph text to indicate to the user that he needs to login in order to get more access to the website
    - if a user reviews our product it will be indicated with a toast message
    - once the superuser approves the review, the registered user has the option to update it or delete its review
- The account page is only displayed to registered user
    - Wishlist:
        - if there are products on the page user can delete a product or add a product to the bag
        - if there are no products text paragraph is displayed on the page, indicating user with the link that he can go to the product page to add products to a wishlist
    - Security:
        - this page allows the user to update his password
        - 3 input fields with confirm button, also help text how to set password is displayed on the page
    - Order history
        - previous orders are displayed with clickable order numbers for each
        - link for each order number will redirect the user to the purchase confirmation summary for that order
    - Purchase confirmation
        - allows a user to have a detailed view of his purchase
        - allows a user to download a pdf version of the receipt
    - Profile info
        - displayed as a simple form for a user to update his delivery information which will be saved
- Bag page
    - as it might increase our business and drive more traffic to our website unregistered users can purchase our products
    - shopping bag is accessible simply by clicking the bag icon in the navigation menu, or during the shopping user can click on the 'secure checkout' button
    - all products that the user has decided to purchase are displayed on the template, also there is an option for a user to change the quantity of the product or to remove it from the bag
- Checkout page
    - page is divided into two sections, order summary, and input form
    - if a user is registered and has saved his profile information in the 'account', the checkout form will be pre-populated with his information
    - if a user is registered and doesn't have saved information on his profile after he populates all the fields he can tick the checkbox to save his information for future purchases
    - site visitors will have to populate all the fields in the form
    - both registered and site visitors are required to provide card details to finalize a purchase
    - upon completion of the purchase user is redirected to view his purchase in the separate template
- Contact page
    - designed as a separate app and model to store data
    - standard contact form input fields are displayed for the user with a conformation toast message displayed after submission and a confirmation email sent to the user address
- Footer
    - displayed on the bottom of every page, colors are matching footer display
    - divided into 3 sections
        - 1: Displayed name of the website with social icon links
        - 2: Quick links that lead a user to the other parts of the website which increases engagement and gives a feel of the more content/complexity of the website
        - 3: Subscription field, which allows users to subscribe to our newsletter and offers. Same as the contact form it is created as a separate model which will save the user's email address and toast messages and confirmation emails are sent to the user
- Additional pages were created to give more credibility to our business
    - About us
        - simple layout page with text and images, which provides users with more information about our business
    - Privacy policy
        - a document that explains how we handle any customer information gathered in its operations
    - Return policy
        - a document that explains our return policy on purchased products
- Admin-related permissions
    - as a superuser, you get more access to the website, 2 additional tabs are displayed in the navigation menu:'admin' which will lead the superuser to the admin panel, and 'add product' which will get a user to the new page which he can add a product directly from the website without using admin panel
    - as a superuser, you can also delete and update products on the website without having to access the admin panel
    - also as a superuser you can choose which reviews/ratings you want to approve from registered users
