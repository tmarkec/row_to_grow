## Design & Planning:
### Business model
- Row to Grow is an e-commerce website that specializes in rowing-related products, such as clothing, accessories, and education. Our business goal is to provide high-quality products at affordable prices, with a focus on serving rowing community. We believe that by focusing on the needs of our customers and providing excellent customer service, we can establish ourselves as a trusted and respected business in the rowing community and beyond since we also have products that are not "rowing-related" and are more for "mainstream" community
 - To achieve our business goals, we carefully select our suppliers based on the quality of their products and their reputation in the industry 
 - To support our business model, we have implemented a range of operational strategies to ensure that we can deliver the best possible customer experience. We offer fast and reliable shipping, easy returns and exchanges, and a customer support team that is available to answer any questions or concerns.By prioritizing customer satisfaction, we believe that we can build long-term relationships with our customers and establish ourselves as a good provider of sports related products.
 - While we are just in the starting phase we would focus more on the local community and domestic area before we scale up.We need to create local regular customers, to test which products are selling best and to stock up before we switched from regular marketing to paid marketing

### Marketing 
#### B2C 
The application is primarily B2C focused, catering to individual customers who wish to purchase rowing related products

#### Current marketing strategies
- At Row to Grow, we understand the importance of effective marketing strategies to drive traffic to our website and increase our sales. Our current marketing strategies include:

- Social Media: We have created a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100092653627209) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rowto_grow/?fbclid=IwAR1LHVbMfc3Ypo-tBhXvJH1TNpzzMbn2iyowSml0UgkYor25RQ4zspwrwGU) page for our business to reach out to potential customers and promote our products. By regularly posting engaging content and interacting with our followers, we aim to build an online presence to increase our brand awareness. Our both pages are live and active but in case they becomes inactive or deactivated I have taken screenshots to display here as well

- Newsletter: We offer a newsletter subscription service to keep our customers up-to-date with our latest products and promotions. By offering exclusive deals and promotions to our subscribers, we aim to foster customer loyalty and encourage repeat business. Upon subscription user receive our initial conformation email from us. First phase is just gather email address in our database then sign up with some provider to setup group emails for promotion of our products/business.

- Partnerships: We have established partnerships with local rowing clubs to promote our products and build brand awareness within the local rowing community. By attending local events and sponsoring local athletes, we aim to establish ourselves as a trusted and respected brand within the community.Also by sponsoring local athletes we extend our reach in marketing area in an old fashion way "Word of a mouth"

#### Future marketing strategies
- usage of the google and facebook ads to promote and target our audience
- usage of the social media influencer to promote our products

### SEO
-  We understand the importance of effective SEO strategies to increase our website's visibility in search engines like Google 
- When planning the SEO strategy for Row to Grow, our e-commerce website focused on rowing-related products, we began by conducting thorough keyword research. We utilized semrush.com and wordtracker.com to identify short tail and long tail keywords that we could use to improve our search engine rankings.

- Our short-tail keywords include terms such as "Rowing Products, Rowing Accessories, Rowing Clothing, Rowing Books, Rowing Gear, Rowing Equipment, Rowing Apparel, Rowing Gift, Rowing" while our long-tail keywords are more specific and include phrases like "Rowing clothing for women, Rowing clothing for men, Rowing books for beginners, Rowing gear for student rowers, Rowing equipment for competitive rowers, Rowing equipment for coaches, Rowing gifts for enthusiasts" By analyzing the results from Google Trends and related search queries, we were able to generate a comprehensive list of targeted keywords.

- We strategically placed these keywords throughout our website, ensuring that they were included in important on-page elements such as headings, descriptions, and URLs. We also made use of the Strong tag where necessary to highlight key phrases and improve our website's overall searchability.

### Wireframes
Below are the wireframes for the site that I created using balsamiq. As I was developing my website I was using agile approach and adding/updating my website/elements so for that reason some wireframes are not matching my final product.

### Agile Methodology
During the development of this project, I implemented Agile development practices to ensure a flexible and iterative approach to the project's progress. The Agile methodology enabled me to adapt to changing requirements and efficiently manage the development process of this project. It is still a learning process for me as this was only my second time doing it so I found that quite bit challenging and time-consuming. I've created Kanban board to manage and visualize the workflow. 
 - Project board was divided into 3 sections:
   - To-Do- (all user stories were initially entered in the 'To Do' column)
   - In Progress- (then during the development phase and implementing functionality stories were moved into the 'In Progress' column)
   - Done- (and then finally they get moved into 'Done' once the development completes and functionality is implemented to cover that user story)

- I've planned 3 iterations for this project. Two were completed as planned and the third one is for future development of the webiste, which is described more in feature features in this document

- Each milestone consists of user stories, which are displayed either open or closed depending on the progress. Each user story is labeled either as 'must-have', 'should-have', or 'could-have' depending on the needs of the project with estimated story points attached to it.

- Each user story has acceptance criteria and tasks that needed to be done to accomplish that criteria

I do realize the importance of the agile approach and documenting all steps and procedures, but it is quite challenging when you are just a team of 1 and you have to write and do everything like multiple people are working on this project. I do think with time and practice better implementation of the methodology can be achieved.


### Typography
For this project I picked Montserrat which is a widely used font known for it's clarity, and versatility. It's clean and modern design makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, including headings, body text, and branding. As a backdrop font I've used 'Sans-serif'.

### Color scheme

# Features

 Navigation: 
  - navigation was coded along the walkthrough video with some modifications. I believe that navigation from a walkthrough video is a good example of an e-commerce website as it displays features like a shopping bag & search bar which indicates what type of website it is
  - navigation sticks on top of the page and it's divided into 2 sections/ rows. The first row consists of the website logo, search bar, login/logout/register button, and basket. The second row displays different pages on the website and the number of displayed links depends if it's site visitor, registered user, or superuser
  - when on medium to small screens the navigation menu changes to the burger menu which shows all the nav links when clicked on

- Product page:
  - products page is fully responsive to allow equal spacing between products regardless of screen width
  - each product consists of an image, title, price, category & rating, special fields are displayed for the superuser which will all be covered in features: "admin"

    - site visitors will have to populate all the fields in the form
    - both registered and site visitors are required to provide card details to finalize a purchase
    - upon completion of the purchase user is redirected to view his purchase in the separate template
