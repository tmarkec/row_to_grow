            <h4>Our story</h4>
            <p>"Row to Grow" began 10 years ago with a simple idea:
                to provide rowing enthusiasts with the highest-quality
                products and gear available. Our founders, all passionate
                rowers themselves, noticed a gap in the market and set goal to fill it up
                and to provide not just <strong>rowing </strong>community but whole active community with
                variety of products.<br> Starting a business from scratch is never easy, but our
                commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction helped us overcome
                the challenges we faced. We worked tirelessly to curate a selection of
                <strong>rowing-related </strong>products that we were proud to offer to our customers.
                Over the years, we've built a reputation for exceptional quality and
                service, and we've expanded our offerings to include everything from
                books and clothing to accessories.</p>
            <h4>Goals</h4>
            <p>Today we remain committed
                to our founding vision: to help the <strong>rowing community</strong> grow by providing
                the tools and resources that rowers need to succeed.
                We're proud of what we've achieved so far, and we look forward to continuing
                to serve our customers for years to come and to expand our area and products we provide you with!</p>
